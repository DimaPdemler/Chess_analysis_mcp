"""Stockfish engine pool with reproducible, cached, fixed-depth analysis.

Design notes:
- Engine processes are *reused*, never spawned per call (a bounded pool guarded by a
  lock). Spawning Stockfish per request is the main performance trap.
- Analysis is at fixed depth so results are reproducible, and cached by
  (fen, depth, multipv) so repeat calls are free and deterministic.
